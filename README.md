# SEO & Accessibility Project

## Changes to HTML & CSS

My task for this project was to update the html file for SEO optimization and to create accessibility. The file was originally created with mainly <div> tags only in the <body> section. My first step was to change all the div tags to semantic tags to improve SEO otimization and accessibility as tasked. This made it much easier to view and categorize the code. 

Once my <div> tags were changed in the html file, I made the corresponding changes to the css file. The original <div> tags also included classes and ids that I thought were unecessary for the most part so I deleted all classes and ids from the html file. I then went on to consolidate the css selectors where applicable to shorten the file and reduce redundancy. 

Once all the above was completed, I realized that the "jump-to" links in the header no longer worked (if they ever did in the first place) and that I needed to correct the links.

I am happy to announce that this is my first README.md file!! This was also my first SEO optimization and refactor of code to make it more accessible. This project was eye-opening for me. The semantics tags make much more sense now and it's easy to see why they are needed.
